	<h2>THE SACRED SCRIPTURE</h2>

	<h3>IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD STICK</h3> 


	<h5>BOOK OF CREATION</h5>
	<p>

		<no>1</no>	In the beginning, there was glue

		The world was solid and set,

		Life was undesirable to the unholy universe <br>

		<no>2</no>	Then there was the great glue gun;

		Everywhere at everytime, heat permeated between the glue,

		Glue gun spread his seed throughout the solid chaos <br>

		<no>3</no>	Then when the gooey white seed was spread

		Stick rest, he slept on the first day, that was time

		For stick was spent, and had lost his wireless connection <br>

		<no>4</no>	On the second day, stick set out to mold his seed in his image

		From the sky he wrathed heat from a terrible heat ray, that he named Sun, after his failed marriage

		For he stated that terrible things were needed to create life from the chaos <br>

		<no>5</no>	It was on this day that the first peoples were born, Ayy Dam and Evie and that Ayy Dam was named High Scepter, or in Polish, Wysokie Berło

		The people were fashioned from the glue that holds together the universe.

		Stick warned them, that he was to be their master and that if from glue they rose, from glue they may return. <br>

		<no>6</no>    On the third day, stick got dangerously high on glue and so bestowed his powers on Ayy Dam, as with his incredible wisdom knew that <br>

	</p>
	<br>

	<h5>The Book of the Flood</h5>
	<p>

		<no>1.</no> 	Many years ago, Stick came to know that the world was smitten by heat, with the Harbinger of Heat’s burning rage pervading all things and all places. <br>

		<no>2.</no>	And so he came unto the Messiah, now in his 10th reincarnation, and winged him messages of solidity, certainty and hope, saying, “come, dear Messiah. See that the world is sinful and filled with the burning anger brought upon it by the Harbinger of Heat”. <br>

		<no>3.</no>	And so The Stick told him, “I shall Spread forth, using the holy glue gun, a great flood of liquid glue. This shall disperse the heat, in line with the laws of thermodynamics, thus evenly distributing the sin”. The Stick instructed the messiah to construct a great latex sheath to protect him and his illegal bootleg Hentai business from destruction. <br>

		<no>4.</no> 	And so the Messiah in his 10th reincarnation did as The Stick commanded, spending many moons knitting together sheet after sheet of personal contraceptive devices into a great protective structure for him and his home. Though his neighbours ridiculed him, filled with their heat-induced anger, he continued, eventually lubricating the latex sheath in preparation for the great flood. <br>

		<no>5.</no>	And so, on the day The Stick had commanded, he brought forth the Holy Glue Gun, spreading forth a great wave of liquid glue. And so the heat was evened, and entropy was restored. <br>

		<no>6.</no>	The Messiah was saved, and rejoiced, singing praises to The Stick for washing away the heat and the sin in the world. <br>

	</p>

	<h5>THE 12 LETTERS OF AYY MEAL</h5>
	<p>

		<no>1</no>	Please give the men of Hungry a meal. I am but a man with a name, but you are the Holy One who spread his seed throughout everything. If you can feed my people I will dedicate my life to spreading your seedlings. <br><br>

		<no>2</no>	Thank you O Great One for spreading your seed to my corner of the globe again. I Thank you in all your majesty, but wish that you could have spread seed to more than just my wife and three daughters. I will do as I promised and continue to spread seedlings throughout my country. <br><br>

		<no>3</no>	Thank you Holy Man of Gluedaism for having you high scepter spread his seed to me, but thought that i was full of seed already and didnt need to have more seed fed to me. I am sorry for doubting you it will not happen again. As always i will continue to spread seedlings. 	<br><br>
